# QuickSwitch
Switch quickly between platforms while using Unity (tested on Unity 2021.3 and Unity 2022.3).

# Install
1. Download the repository, you can do it by using `git clone` or just using the [download]() button in the GitHub page.
2. Place the downloaded files inside the `Assets/Editor` folder
3. Done!

# How to use
Once you installed the plugin, a "Tools" tab will appear in the navigation bar, there you will find a "Quick Switch" option and inside that, you will find options that allows you to switch to other platforms.

The first time you switch to another platform, the process will take some time due to the cache, after that, switching platforms will be really fast.

# Credits
To make this, I used many resources that I found on the internet months ago... so I don't remember where I got the majority of the source code... but anyways, big thanks to the people that made this possible!
